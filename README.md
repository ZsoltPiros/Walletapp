# fullStackToDo

I want the development to be done by these technological principles:


-The application should have a database, with table and fields, you see fit to the application.


-The application should have a server.js, which is in nodejs and express, and communicates with the db.


-The application should have index.html, style.css (handwritten), and control.js (vanillajs).



The app should work like:
-I can store todos, save them, delete them, check them out (to sign its done), and mark them as IMPORTANT,
which would make it put the IMPORTANT ones on the top of my list.
